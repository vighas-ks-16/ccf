                     <p>At our <i>Carbon Footprint Calculator</i>, we believe in the power of choices to shape our environmental impact. <br>
                        From the size of your home to your dietary preferences, each decision matters. Larger houses typically leave a larger footprint, while apartments and smaller homes have a smaller impact. Choosing vegetarian or vegan options lowers your carbon footprint, and fresh, local food reduces it further. Opting for secondhand items and minimizing waste helps to shrink your environmental impact.
                        <br> Our easy assessment tool provides insights – below 60 points, your planet-friendly impact is significant; beyond 60, let's work together to reduce it.
                        <br> Join us in creating a sustainable future!</p>

                           A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted into the atmosphere as a result of various human activities, particularly carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon footprints can be connected to a person, a company, a product, or an event, among other things.
                        </p>
                        <div class="hidden-content">
                          <p>
                           A carbon footprint, defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the amount of CO2 emissions produced in tons, is a measurement of the effect that human activities have on the volume of carbon dioxide (CO2) created through the combustion of fossil fuels. The ecological footprint is thought of as a subset of the carbon footprint. The ecological footprint compares the total resources people use with the amount of land and water required to replace those resources. The carbon footprint deals with resource usage but only considers the greenhouse gases released as a result of burning fossil fuels.

The six gases that are recognized as green house gases under Kyoto protocol are- Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbon (PFCs) and Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6). The standard unit of measurement for carbon footprints is equivalent tones of carbon dioxide (CO2e), over the course of a year. The emissions of each of the six greenhouse gases are multiplied by their 100-year global warming potential to produce CO2e (GWP). When comparing the carbon footprints of different energy production methods, coal has the highest carbon footprint, followed by oil, natural gas, and geothermal energy. There are two types of carbon footprints- emissions from all organizational operations, including energy use, industrial processes, and company cars. Emissions from a product’s whole life, which includes the extraction of raw materials, manufacture, usage, and eventual reuse, recycling, or disposal.
<br> 
Effects of Carbon footprint-

A country’s deforestation activities and our increased usage of air conditioners in our houses both result in increased carbon emissions that deplete large-scale resources. The impact of carbon footprints on climate change is significant. The atmosphere’s greenhouse gas emissions cause the world to warm. The warmest decade on record, according to records kept by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), occurred from 2011 to 2020. The emissions of carbon dioxide grew by 31% between 1990 and 2005. By 2008, the emissions have increased radioactive warming- a change in the energy balances of the Earth toward warming- by 35% over 1990 levels.
<br>
Reduction of Carbon Footprint-

Around the world, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tones. By 2050, it must fall below 2 tones in order to prevent the possibility of a 2 degree Celsius rise in the global temperature.

The ways that we might lessen our carbon footprints are as follows- it can be decreased through increasing energy efficiency, altering lifestyles, and modifying consumer behaviors, such as avoiding products with excessive packaging, use the four R’s: refuse, reduce, recycle, and reuse, changing one’s energy and transportation habits can reduce one’s overall carbon footprint, utilizing compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs)  replace standard light bulb, avoid flying connecting flights as a tone of carbon dioxide is released for every 5,000 miles travelled in an airplane or 2,500 miles driven in a medium-sized automobile, take the bus or a more energy-efficient vehicle, instead of using bikes, cars, etc., you should walk or ride a bike, converting to a less-carbon-intensive energy source from coal and more tree planting.

                        <h3>Rising Sea Levels and Coastal Vulnerability</h3>
                        <p>As carbon footprints contribute to global warming, they lead to the thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of polar ice. This combination results in rising sea levels, which threaten coastal regions with increased risks of flooding, erosion, and displacement of populations. Low-lying coastal areas and island nations are particularly vulnerable.</p>

                        <p>Carbon footprints, primarily from the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), contribute significantly to climate change. These emissions trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming. This warming disrupts weather patterns, causes melting of ice and glaciers, intensifies extreme weather events, and has widespread impacts on ecosystems and human societies.</p>
